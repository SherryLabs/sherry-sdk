Sherry SDK is a powerful toolkit for building interactive Web3 **mini-apps** that can be embedded directly within social media posts. The SDK enables developers to create rich, composable blockchain experiences without requiring users to leave their social media feed.

With Sherry, you can transform any post into an interactive dApp that allows users to swap tokens, vote on proposals, mint NFTs, sign transactions, transfer assets, interact with APIs, and much moreâ€”all with built-in validation and a unified experience across multiple blockchains.
